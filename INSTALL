 -----------------
( TROUBLESHOOTING )
 -----------------

For those that have systems where the bash executable isn't located 
in /bin/bash, you should fix it of two ways:
	
1)  Create a symlink from the executable to /bin/bash (recommend).
 $ ln -s /path/to/bash /bin/bash

2)  To look all scripts for the line '/usr/bin/env bash' and replace it
with '/path/to/bash' us to has used find and perl command for found and adjust
(very hard, not recommend):
 $ find -type f -perm /a+x -exec perl -i.back -pe 's/^#!\/bin\/bash$/#!\/path\/to\/bash\//' {} \;
